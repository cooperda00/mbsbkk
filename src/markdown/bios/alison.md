I was born in the UK, adopted Australia and I have now marinated in Thailand for 10 years. I never shy away from travel or a solidly challenging cultural experience! Iâ€™m an ardent spiritual enquirer, holistic practitioner and coach, passionate about supporting individuals to rediscover their truth, and live their most free and fulfilling life. I love creation, sharing, learning and discovery, all the best bits of MBSBKK. The fair is my way of surviving and thriving in BKK, whilst inspiring others to do the same.

Reiki and EFT are my loves and two of the greatest gifts in my life. The other two are my teens ðŸ’œ
