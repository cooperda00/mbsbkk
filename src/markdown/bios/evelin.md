I am Hungarian by birth, yet I see myself as a global citizen having travelled and lived in a diversity of locations. After discovering the transformative power of yoga, I completed my 240-hour yoga teacher training in Hatha Yoga in Rishikesh, India. I have been mindfully sharing my love of yoga throughout Bangkok and beyond ever since.

As a lifetime student of all things holistic, be it the power and healing properties of crystals, affirmations, vibration, or essential oils, MBSBKK is truly my idea of heaven! We are so excited to share it with you ðŸ˜ƒ
