## Join the Mind Body Spirit Fair community

(Find your tribe & feel the vibe!)

If you are in the health, wellbeing, inspiration or sustainability business, your local and international customers are here and ready to connect with you!

At the Mind Body Spirit Fair Bangkok you’ll find a targeted crowd of health and wellness seeking visitors who are looking for You! Something generic fairs can’t provide.

As well as being Bangkok’s first dedicated holistic healing and wellness event, MBSBKK is a charity fundraiser, supporting local projects, directly benefiting Thai people. Find out more about our charitable contributions. Join us and give back. Together we can make a difference.

## Exhibit with us

**Take a stall to sell**, promote or showcase your products or services, in a purchase ready, niche customer environment. Our visitors are gonna want what you have!

### Exhibitor’s appreciation:

_“The event exceeded all expectations, the only regret was that our stall was so busy, we wished we would have been able to experience the whole thing more. What a great ‘problem’ to have. We can’t wait for the next one”_

_“An amazingly generous event chock full of loving offerings for body mind and soul. Not to mention all the fabulous humans!”_

_“It was such a pleasure to meet so many individuals of like minds! No explanations needed they just got where we were at. I had the most successful two days!”_

_“From a workshop presenter point of view, the event was very well organised! Loved how the assigned volunteers took care of every request we had.”_
