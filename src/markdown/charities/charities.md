# Our Charities

## Bringing together a community to give back

In our vision to bring Bangkok's holistic health and well-being community together, we saw the perfect opportunity to give something back to those who need it the most. This has become the very essence of the Mind Body and Spirit Fair Bangkok.

â€‹We chose a community partner which is very close to our hearts, The Fatima Centre, which relys greatly on charitable donations and fund raising to do their valuable work, providing services for some of Thailand's most vulnerable individuals.

Visit their website to find out more about their projects and the work they do, and to make further donations.

Proceeds from admission fees will go towards supporting this charity. If you needed another reason to get involved, you just found it.

Through MBSBKK 2018 we were able to make 220, 000 baht in charitable contributions.

Together we can make a difference.
